 find noise data points and irregular shape ...
kmeans only  represented in spherical shape,whereas diviscan can be in any shape.
 TWO PARAMETERS::
   1)EPS:Epsilon(radius of sphere)
   2)Min point
# Three types of points are present in the DBSCan Ex:epsilon=3,minpoint=4
     i)Core point(if min point present in epsilon)
    ii)Boundary point(min point not present in epsilon)
    iii)Noise point(single point)
